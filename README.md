Hi, you can call me Edward. I just graduated from [DTU](https://www.dtu.dk/), and work as a software engineer at [Utiligize](https://www.utiligize.com/).

I am familiar with techniques in mathematical simulation, optimisation and graph theory. Currently, I am contributing to [zequnyu/cmdict](https://github.com/zequnyu/cmdict).

You can know more about me through https://edxu96.github.io/ and have a look at [my resume](https://edxu96.github.io/files/resume.pdf).
