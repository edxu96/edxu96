Hi, you can call me Edward. I am a student in Denmark and becoming a junior scientific software developer this December.

I am very good at stochastic simulation, optimisation and graph theory. Currently, I am busy with my industrial-collaborative project on toplogy inference for radial distribution feeders, which is not open-sourced, yet.

You can know more about me by checking my website https://edxu96.github.io/ and have a look at [my CV](https://edxu96.github.io/CV.pdf).
