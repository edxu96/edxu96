Hi, you can call me Edward. I am a student in Denmark and becoming a junior scientific software developer this December.

I am very good at stochastic simulation, optimisation and graph theory. Currently, I am working on industrial thesis on toplogy inference for radial distribution feeders.

You can know more about me by checking my website https://edxu96.github.io/.
