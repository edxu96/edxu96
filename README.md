Hi, you can call me Edward. I am a student in Denmark and becoming a junior scientific software developer this December.

I am familiar with techniques in mathematical simulation, optimisation and graph theory. Currently, I am busy with my industrial-collaborative project on toplogy inference for radial distribution feeders, which is not open-sourced, yet. But API is shown in https://edxu96.github.io/EstRDF-docs/. Besides, you can know my coding level from my latest contribution in [zequnyu/cmdict](https://github.com/zequnyu/cmdict).

You can know more about me by checking my website https://edxu96.github.io/ and have a look at [my CV](https://edxu96.github.io/CV.pdf).
